Hello. This is a customised version of the [Marfa theme](https://github.com/microdotblog/theme-marfa) that I use for my [personal website](https://cleardemon.com), hosted on [micro.blog](https://micro.blog).

There is no content here, only a theme. You should probably look at the actual website.

This repo has to be public so micro.blog can update the hosted theme, if and when it changes.
